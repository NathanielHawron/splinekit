# splinekit
Toolkit for generating arbitrary splines with maximum controls

# Features
- Arbitrarily ordered splines (For higher order control)
- Arbitrary parameterization (For controling motion)
- Arbitrary dimensions (For any degree of freedom and auxiliary info)
- Parameter limits with dimensional filtering (For physically limited systems with non-physical attributes)
- Adaptive sampling (For consistent detail and higher performance)
- Spline length estimation
- Extrema calculations
- Variable spline duration
- Spline translator / approximator
- Presets for common and basic splines
- Inverse parameterization
- Basic collisions
- Sample spline editor
